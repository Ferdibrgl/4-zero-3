Below are some basic requirements and steps to become a cyber security expert:

# Step 1: Education Requirements

Firstly, you must fulfil the basic educational requirement to pursue your career in cyber security. You should have a bachelor's degree in computer science, information technology or a similar field with an emphasis on cyber security.

Obtaining a bachelor's degree in the mentioned fields can help you gain basic knowledge about firewalls, computer networks, cyber security measures, cryptography and coding. To be successful in this field it is essential to be proficient in programming languages.

The course will also familiarise you with multiple computer languages such as JAVA etc. and the latest cyber security trends. A bachelor's degree in a related field can also help you land an entry-level job in cyber security. For example, you can get a job as a cyber security analyst in an organisation that does not require you to have any experience.

# Step 2: Acquire Relevant Technical and Soft Skills

Certain technical skills are a prerequisite for becoming successful and sought-after cyber security experts. Therefore, you must acquire these technical skills and be good at them.

First of all, you must be good at coding. Get a working knowledge of programming languages such as JAVA, Python, C++ and other cutting-edge technologies. Hands-on experience using tools like PowerShell and OpenSSH is desirable.

This will enable you to design security solutions, task automation, etc. in the field. It helps to have a thorough understanding of cyber security related concepts. Here are a few of them:

Security Incident Handling and Response: A cybersecurity professional should be able to address any possible danger of an existing breach of an organisation's security guidelines or standard cybersecurity procedures. Such security breaches can include malware, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, etc.

SIEM Management: As a cybersecurity professional, you should be able to manage security information and event management (SIEM) services and tools. You will also need to produce automation using SIEM tools to understand the real-time assessment delivered through alerts and translate them into incident-response plans.

Audit and Compliance: A cybersecurity professional needs to comprehensively re-evaluate the organisation's compliance with regulatory policies, including HIPAA, PCI DSS, COBIT, ISO 27001 and 20000. missed scopes that can lead to critical penalties and liabilities for the organisation.

Analytics and Intelligence: A security professional must leverage analytics and gather intelligence to quickly recognise and catch attacks. In addition, using analytics and collected intelligence enables the expert to bring networks and applications together with data to stop attacks.

Firewall/IDS/IPS Skills: A cybersecurity professional should use the power of a firewall to scan network traffic to avoid unauthorised entries into the network. Therefore, the cybersecurity professional must have a thorough knowledge of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and understand their relationship to the firewall. Intrusion Detection: To be a successful security professional, you must be able to use IDS to detect suspicious traffic and security policy violations. All this technical knowledge and expertise will help you succeed as a cyber security expert. You can acquire the necessary skills and knowledge related to the previously mentioned concepts by enrolling in advanced training sessions, online tutorials, workshops, webinars, and other resources such as books.

Certain technical skills are a prerequisite to becoming successful and sought-after cybersecurity professionals. Therefore, you should acquire these technical skills and be good at them. You can start by enrolling in a certified ethical hacker course.
