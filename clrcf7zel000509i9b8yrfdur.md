> *This is your path to a career in cybersecurity. This certification program is the requested files that will get you started in less than 6 months. No degree or experience required.*

“This certification program delivers the requested file information that can make you job ready in less than 6 months. **There is no need for any diploma or experience** .”

IMO, without a diploma in hand, no one is stopping you from learning the course material and getting certified. But on the other hand, employers will definitely demand a degree with experience as the Cyber ​​Security market is **extremely saturated .** and I mean EXTREMELY SATURATED **.**

> *Even guys with degrees and recordable experience are having a hard time finding work these days.*

**Google** has divided this certification into Eight courses; Each one teaches you valuable theories and is combined into practical learning as you gain more knowledge and level up.

# **Distribution of Courses**

# **1\. Fundamentals of Cyber ​​Security**

Starting some foundations is always met with emotions. **It teaches you basic concepts like how to run cyber attacks into business** , **security ethics, frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and some tools** for use in the normal “not-so-exciting” lives of analysts .

# **2\. Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks**

This course teaches you Risk management concepts including threats and vulnerabilities. And it is a useful SOC tool called Security Information and Event Management (SIEM). In modern SOC, even incident response functionality won't work without SIEM.

# **3\. Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security**

The Internet is a network of networks, this course includes modules on networking, including how protocols work and how to transmit recorded data, including various copies, to thwart intrusion attacks.

# **4\. Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL**

Here are the basics of system administrator. The entire tutorial will be compiled around the operating system and how to communicate specifically around the Linux file system, even people around are struggling with Linux so it's good to have a solid idea of ​​bash as well as interacting with the SQL database.

# **5\. Assets, Threats and Vulnerabilities**

Again examining the blocking of Assets Risk management concepts such as analyzing attack surfaces for risk identification, identifying common threats (malware, phishing and exploits) and a very useful Threat system process.

# **6\. Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response**

This part, important from a defensive security perspective, means direct availability to a SOC analyst with actual operational logs. In this chapter you will learn about Event description, analyzing network packets, performing queries in instruction detection systems (IDS) and (SIEM). I would recommend you to focus more on your intelligence in this section because this will help you do well in interviews overall.

# **7\. Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python**

Python, no matter how interesting its features sound, rarely comes in handy on normal days, but in this section we expect some scripting and data partitioning techniques, including Regular expression (RegEx) and code error details in Python.

# **8\. Put It to Work: How to Prepare for Cybersecurity Jobs**

Here, Google provides some important career advice that spring security professionals need to get started, including job search, getting active in communities, and negotiation preparation that are absolutely essential to landing your first “dream job” in cybersecurity.

# **living out of sight**

The entire program is divided into eight comprehensive courses that you can cover effectively for 6 months. But if you already have basic IT knowledge like networking and operating systems, you can do all this in half. For someone with a non-IT background, the full 6 months of investment are fulfilled when one decides to enroll in cybersecurity as a **SOC analyst .**

Although it covers a lot of beginner expressions, that alone won't beat someone with experience.

> ***If you're starting out advising as a SOC analyst*** *with minimal fundamental impact for the deployment situation , you'll be on board. For someone who is currently lacking and wants to spread the basics again, this would still be quite useful.*

I do not have financial aid for someone who has 171,914 currently registered.

**Step 3:** Click on the small “Financial Aid Available” button just below the large “Enroll for Free” tab. Resist your clicks by clicking on the big highlighted blue tab, it's a trap!!! You will only need to have access for 7 days and then pay. So friends, it's not free at all.

Tell them about yourself, your background (please don't be mean), develop your passion for the course and what you've done about it, if any. Basically, you can simply sell yourself and choose what you can't afford to take the course in the established environment, such as job loss or being a student and being completely secretive about adequate care/pocket money just for nutrition. Your article must be at least 150 words.

Below I share my personal writing as an example;

**TOPIC 1**

I have a degree in Child Development and Family Studies and am transitioning into cybersecurity and training on educational portals such as Cisco skillforall, Netacad and Letsdefend website. As a young woman looking to gain knowledge and skills in the field of cybersecurity, we have highly tried these courses with Labs offering hands-on experience. Obtaining certification from this course will become members of a professional level training and will provide me with interviews with potential employers.

However, it is difficult for me to meet this financial amount. I am currently unemployed due to job opportunities in my area. I maximize this time for cybersecurity development to be ready for the security operations center (SOC) analyst role.

I must decide that this course is where it is needed for my career and that I will work passionately to continue my education. By helping me financially, you will help me overcome a major obstacle at the beginning of their professional development. The knowledge I will gain from this course will enable me to achieve my goal and will make significant contributions to the cyber security industry.

**Second Essay: How will the course you choose help your goal?**

Typically: Talk about how the course will help you achieve your career goal. Don't abstract your goals, talk about the outcome and how the course will help you achieve it. Be practical! Talk about the module and its knowledge and how to contribute. How the acquired information should be recorded and stored later.

Below I share my personal writing as an example;

**Trial 2**

As an aspiring security operations center (SOC) analyst, I am confident that this course will equip me with the essential training and skills necessary for my career goal.

My ultimate budget is working for a reputable cybersecurity firm. The Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification will definitely help me achieve the goal by ensuring I fully understand how to protect networks, devices, people, and data from cyber attacks. Additionally, the course focuses on Security Incident Response, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Linus using the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool, playbook, which is essential for my career plan.

It is versatile from the opportunity to learn from different professionals and gain practical experience through hands-on work with a simulated method. This is distinguished from the solution by helping to improve problem solving and analytical analysis, which are the core characteristics of a SOC analyst.

As a result, the Google Cyber ​​Security course will help me improve my technique and keep up with the field of cyber security with its comprehensive curriculum. This will enable me to keep up to date with the latest developments in cybersecurity and contribute to the advancement of the industry by learning about emerging trends and technologies.

**Step 7:** Accept the terms and conditions, write “I accept the above terms” in the box, prove that you are not a robot and submit your application.

**Step 8:** Completing this process 8 times!

The Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification consists of 8 courses, and each course must be optioned as a standalone entity. The whole process we do is only valid for the first course, you need to apply for financial aid to access the other 7 courses.

*When you follow these steps, your approval documents increase.*

***NOTE: Give up on plagiarism! I put my personal essay here so you can visualize what a Coursera winning essay looks like. Personalize your own article, make it as original as possible.***

For those not interested in cybersecurity, these steps will work perfectly for any course on the Coursera platform that interests you. Just follow the tips and give well.
