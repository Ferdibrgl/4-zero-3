##### ABOUT THE EVENT

### **Will you be the last faction standing?**

"We used to be peaceful and had enough tech to keep us all happy. What do you think about that?  
  
These data disks alluded to some "societal golden age." No fighting, no backstabbing, and no factions fighting for some lousy title.  
  
Good, great for them-  
  
Because all we get to look forward to is "The Fray."  
  
*alarms blaring*  
  
Oh, look-... it's showtime." (Quote: Luxx, faction leader of the Phreaks)  
  
üí• Welcome to "The Fray." A societal gauntlet made of the most cunning, dedicated, and bloodthirsty factions. We are all bound by the same rule‚Äìbe one of the last factions standing. All brought to your overlords and sponsors at KORP‚Ñ¢.  
  
Our city's lights bring people from far and wide. It's one of the last remaining mega structures left after the Great Division took place. But, as far as we are concerned, KORP‚Ñ¢ is all there ever was and will be  
  
They hold The Fray every four years to find the "best and the brightest around." Those who make it through their technological concoction of challenges become the "Legionaries," funded factions who get to sit on easy streets for the time between the next fight.  
  
**The current Legionaries are:**  
  
üëπ **The Phreaks:** The telecom companies banded together under the guidance of a motley crew of hackers who hijacked their entire base of operations. Their goal is seemingly to keep the party rolling, but under the hood, they always seem to be planning something. They are the most likely to help newer factions.  
  
üí∞ **The Profits:** They say your salvation is worth its weight in gold; for them, it's not a figure of speech. This faction consists of the legacy of economic leaders, market analysts, and creators of quant software. More than any other faction, they want to be a part of KORP.  
  
üé• **The Talents:** Online celebrities and software developers came together to create their vision for the future. In the end, they want all eyes on them. Their drive for glory and views pushes them to perform incredible feats actively.  
  
üå≤ **The Revivalists:** This faction aims to bring down the current system and start from the basics, rocks and sticks. They want to return to a natural way of life and leave tech behind, believing society needs a reboot. Despite being one of the legionaries, they are vocal about dismantling KORP.  
  
‚ùì **The Factionless:** More and more people seem to arrive every day, looking for opportunities to succeed and create factions of their own. Until they find their place, they are known as Factionless.  
  
There have been rumblings about this year being different. There are rumors of factions banding together to stop The Fray once and for all.

**How about it? Will your faction rise to the top? Or will you be the one to tear down the system?**
